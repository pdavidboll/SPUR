# `spur`: A Stata Package around Spatial Unit Roots

This package implements methods for diagnosing and correcting spatial unit roots developed by Müller and Watson (2024). A practical guide to these methods and the Stata implementation can be found in [Becker, Boll and Voth (2025)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2025/twerp_1541-_becker.pdf).

**When using this code, please cite [Becker, Boll and Voth (2025)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2025/twerp_1541-_becker.pdf):**

## Installation

Installation from GitHub:

    . net install spur, replace from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdavidboll/spur/main/)

If you *also* want to download the example data and do-file (will be saved to the current directory), run the following *in addition to the above*:

    . net get spur, replace from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdavidboll/spur/main/)

Then, you can run the example do-file, which reproduces Table 1 from [Müller and Watson (2024)](https://www.princeton.edu/~umueller/SPUR.pdf) based on the data from [Chetty et. al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qju022) (see [Becker, Boll and Voth (2025)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2025/twerp_1541-_becker.pdf) for details):

    . do example

## Basic Usage

The package is made up of three commands: `spurtest`, `spurtransform`, and `spurhalflife`. Example uses of these commands are shown below.

```stata
// Test the null hypothesis of a spatial unit root in the variable am
spurtest i1 am, latlong

// Transform the variable am to remove the spatial unit root and save the transformed variable as h_am
spurtransform am, prefix("h_") latlong

// Construct a confindence interval for the spatial half-life of the transformed variable am
spurhalflife am, latlong                

```
For details, see the help files, as well as [Becker, Boll and Voth (2025)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2025/twerp_1541-_becker.pdf).
